## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  4 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 20,000 USD

### Milestone 1 â€” Implement power-users search module

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | proprietary
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and basic tutorial on how to deploy and run created module.
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Power-users-search module: X | We will create a module that will search for power users of a smart contract, given the indexed blockchain data in described format.  


### Milestone 2 - Implement look-a-like module

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 5,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | proprietary
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and basic tutorial on how to deploy and run created module.

| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Look-a-like module: X | We will create a module that will create look-a-like (embeded vector) representation of a power users in user space

### Milestone 3 - Implement users similarity module and users activity module

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 5,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |

| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article** and perform a workshop that explains how to use created API and how to receive value from this product.
| 1. | Users similarity module | We will create a module that will find most similar users in whole NEAR blockchain given specific set of look-a-likes
| 2. | Similar contracts search module | We will create module that will find and count how many potential similar to look-a-like users interacted with each smart contract (with at list 1 interaction during given past period)
| 3. | API setup | We will run an API, which Mintbase users or Mintbase itself can use or integrate in Mintbase UI

## Future Plans

In future we are looking forward:
- rewrite data extraction module (not covered by this grant application) to user NEAR Lake data (for Google Cloud) instead of NEAR Indexer for Explorer data
- receive feedback on value of created features and adjust roadmap of future work
- create recommender system for NFT marketplaces
- blend web2 & web3 data to enhance user acquisition
