## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
Metronomo is a cross-chain user growth infrastracture

#### Problem
We asked 7 web3 projects about their biggest challenges. All of them mentioned user acqusition as an urgent issue.
That's how we had started building "hubspot for web3". But from the very beginning we faced 2 problems:
1. On-chain data fragmented and poorly structured to create user profiles 
2. ETL and mapping is resource intensive and expensive

#### Solution
Create basic data layer for building marketing tools:
- structure and combine on-chain data into users, projects, transactions and other relevant dimensions
- provide API to access and manage data
- give a techology for building martech products (e.g. NFT recommender and personalization system, matching web2 and web3 user data, zero party data system, knowledge and social graph and others)

#### Why we do
- Our team has 10+ year experience in digital marketing, analytics and engineering.
- We are highly confident that on-chain data has a unique role in scaling web3 products and ecosystem as a whole.
- So we see our mission as **make web3 martech great to the next bull run**


### Project Details



### Ecosystem Fit
#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
We see our project as the user growth module of Mintbase now and afterwards as part of marketplace contract 2.0

#### Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Mintbase ecosystem projects

#### What need(s) does your project meet?

As the part of marketplace contract 2.0 allow merchants to create product selections based on user profiles and similarity to other projects to grow revenue

#### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
Wombi

#### If so, how is your project different?
We are focused on tools for NFT projects

#### If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Mintbase Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
